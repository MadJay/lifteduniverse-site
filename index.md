  headline: Lifted Universe
  content: Lifted is a superhero setting. Select humans have been manifesting powers
    over the last three years. Why? Play to find out. I don’t have an answer for my
    game yet. I’ll share some thoughts. I’ve lifted ideas from WildCATS, Stormwatch,
    Planetary, and The Authority. These are the comics I grew up with and grew old
    with. I love underdog struggles, soap-opera drama, one-liners, reboots—all those
    things, which are woven into the fabric of these books and characters’ worlds.<br><br>“Lifted
    vol.1 is Primed by Cortex, the award-winning world-building tabletop RPG system
    for forging unique, compelling game experiences from a set of modular rules mechanics"<br><br>

  content: 'Select humans are manifesting powers. <strong>Project: OWL</strong> collects
    intel on these <em>Lifted beings</em>. Watching, learning without ever interfering
    or being exposed. Now as more Lifted manifestations happen in the public worldwide,
    <strong>Project: OWL</strong> are the experts and they can no longer sit on the
    sidelines, and neither can you! <br><strong>Lifted</strong> is my love letter
    to the X-Men, WildCATS, StormWatch, Planetary, and Authority. These are the comics
    I grew up with and grew old with. I love the underdog struggles, the soap opera
    drama, one-liners, and the reboots. The superpowered Lifted are the setting’s
    focus. They have the full attention of governments and private industries. How
    do you track them? Control them? How can they be weaponized? There is no Professor
    Xavier or Jacob Marlowe - they are fictional characters. So Lifted, what are YOU
    gonna do Now? <br><br><strong>Champions Now RPG</strong> is the core system I’ll
    use to stat out the <strong>Lifted</strong> universe in <em>vault01</em>, but
    I''ll also have plenty of Lifted setting to be used in other game systems.'
