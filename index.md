  content: '<strong><span class="bold">Lifted: Indomitable</span></strong> is a roleplaying
    game about people manifesting superpowers in a world unbalanced by treacherous
    secrets and advanced technology run amok. You will take on the roles of people
    with powers struggling against techno-aggressive organizations, otherworldly intelligences,
    and other powerful Lifted, all of who want to control everyone and everything.
    Make your choices in a world where powers are extraordinary, and the stigma of
    having them grows stronger each day.<br>Lifted is inspired by comics like WildCATS,
    Stormwatch, Planetary, The Authority, and of course, all the X-Men books. The
    Lifted are the center of attention. They have the focus of governments, private
    enterprises, and other ne''er do wells. These organizations have humanity-based
    fears: How do you track these Lifted people? How do you control them? Can they
    be weaponized? Can they be stopped? or neutralized, contained? Will they subjugate
    humans? Are the Lifted connected to the <em><span class="text-italic">exclusion
    zone</span></em> phenomena?<br>Movies like Power, Bright, Spectral, and Code 8
    are great examples of these fears given resources and were inspirational to this
    setting. There is no Professor Xavier or Jacob Marlowe, no Superman—they never
    existed in this world; It’s on YOU as a Lifted character to make or break the
    day. What are YOU going to do Now? Game Moderators, you won’t need to wait around
    to see what these new characters will do; there is a Lifted Universe of NPCs with
    agendas to get done.<br><br><strong><span class="bold">Lifted is Primed by Cortex</span></strong>,

    game experiences from a set of modular rules mechanics. The same system that made
    Marvel Heroic RPG AMAZING!'

  content: 'Select humans are manifesting powers. <strong>Project: OWL</strong> collects
    intel on these <em>Lifted beings</em>. Watching, learning without ever interfering
    or being exposed. Now, as more Lifted manifestations happen in the public worldwide,
    <strong>Project: OWL</strong> are the experts, and they can no longer sit on the
    sidelines, and neither can you! <br><br><strong>Lifted</strong> is my love letter
    to the X-Men, WildCATS, StormWatch, Planetary, and Authority. These are the comics
    I grew up with and grew old with. I love the underdog struggles, soap opera drama,
    one-liners, and the reboots. The superpowered Lifted are the setting’s focus.
    They have the full attention of governments and private industries. How do you
    track them? Control them? How can they be weaponized? There is no Professor Xavier
    or Jacob Marlowe - they are fictional characters. <br>So Lifted, what are YOU
    gonna do Now? <br><br><strong>Champions Now RPG</strong> is the core system I’ll
    use to stat out the <strong>Lifted</strong> universe in <em>vault01</em>, but
    I''ll also have plenty of Lifted setting to be used in other game systems.<br><br><a
