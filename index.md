  content: 'Select humans are manifesting powers. <strong>Project: OWL</strong> collects
    intel on these <em>Lifted beings</em>. Watching, learning without ever interfering
    or being exposed. Now as more Lifted manifestations happen in the public worldwide,
    <strong>Project: OWL</strong> are the experts and they can no longer sit on the
    sidelines, and neither can you! <br><strong>Lifted</strong> is my love letter
    to the X-Men, WildCATS, StormWatch, Planetary, and Authority. These are the comics
    I grew up with and grew old with. I love the underdog struggles, the soap opera
    drama, one-liners, and the reboots. The superpowered Lifted are the setting’s
    focus. They have the full attention of governments and private industries. How
    do you track them? Control them? How can they be weaponized? There is no Professor
    Xavier or Jacob Marlowe - they are fictional characters. So Lifted, what are YOU
    gonna do Now? <br><br><strong>Champions Now RPG</strong> is the core system I’ll
    use to stat out the <strong>Lifted</strong> universe in <em>vault01</em>, but
    I''ll also have plenty of Lifted setting to be used in other game systems.'
